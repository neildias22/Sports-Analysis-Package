# Sports-Analysis-Package

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script for performing sports data analysis, focusing on basketball player statistics. The script utilizes the pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries to analyze the data and visualize player and team performance. The main goal of this project is to gain insights into basketball players' performance and compare their statistics.

## Introduction
Basketball is an exciting sport with a rich dataset of player statistics. This project aims to create an analysis package to analyze and visualize basketball player data to uncover insights into player performance and compare individual players.

## Requirements
To run the sports data analysis script, you'll need the following:

Python (3.x recommended) with the required libraries: pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
A CSV file containing the basketball player data.

## Data Analysis
The SportsAnalysis class in the Python script contains methods to calculate player statistics, such as total points, rebounds, and assists, as well as career stats like years of activity, height, and weight.

## Data Visualization
The visualize_player_performance method creates bar plots to visualize the performance of a specific player in terms of points, rebounds, and assists. The visualize_team_performance method creates a scatter plot to visualize a team's performance in terms of points and rebounds.
